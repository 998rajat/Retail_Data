### Monthly Revenue Trend

- Extracted month from `OrderDate` and calculated total sales
- Line chart used to show month-over-month sales trend

### Top 5 Products by Quantity Sold

- Grouped by product and summed quantity
- Identified most in-demand products for marketing or inventory decisions

###  Sales by Product â€“ Bar Chart

- Visual comparison of total sales per product
- Helps identify top revenue-generating items

###  Share of Each Product â€“ Pie Chart

- Product quantity distribution visualized as percentages
- Useful for inventory mix and category-level planning

###  Day with Highest Sales

- Aggregated daily sales
- Revealed top-performing sales day

###  Customer-wise Total Purchase

- Sales grouped by customer
- Identified high-value customers for loyalty targeting

###  Correlation Heatmap (Optional)

- Analyzed relationships between `Quantity`, `Price`, and `Sales`
